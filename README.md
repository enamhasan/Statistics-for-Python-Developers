# Statistics-with-Python
Basic Statistics for Python Developers


For data analysis, having a good understanding of applied statistics is essential. Here are some basic concepts in applied statistics that are particularly useful in data analysis for Python Developers. We will try to describe the necessary statistical methods first then we will apply python libraries to implement the statistical result.

### 1. Mean
It is calculated by dividing the total number of observations by the sum of the observations. It can also be described as the sum divided by the count. In another word it simply a mathematical average.

```
import statistics
# list of positive integer numbers
data1 = [1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 2]
x = statistics.mean(data1)
# Printing the mean
print("Mean is :", x)
```
Output:

```
Mean is : 4.428571428571429
```


### 2. Median
### 3. Mode
### 4. Standard Deviation
### 5. Range
### 6. Variance
